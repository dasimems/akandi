                Once a car has been purchased by an export buyer through
                Kvdcars, it will be deregistered in Sweden and the existing
                number plate will be removed
                <span> We do not arrange any temporary plates.</span> The
                easiest way for you as the buyer is to have a transport company
                collect the car and transport it to the desired country.
